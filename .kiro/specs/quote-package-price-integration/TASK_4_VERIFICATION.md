## Manual Testing Checklist

To manually verify this implementation:

1. **Open PackageSelector**
   - [ ] Modal opens correctly
   - [ ] Packages list loads

2. **Select a Package**
   - [ ] Package details display
   - [ ] Parameters form appears

3. **Enter Parameters**
   - [ ] Number of people input works
   - [ ] Number of nights dropdown works
   - [ ] Arrival date picker works

4. **Price Calculation**
   - [ ] "Calculating..." appears immediately
   - [ ] Apply button disabled during calculation
   - [ ] Price displays after calculation
   - [ ] Breakdown shows correct values

5. **Apply Selection**
   - [ ] Apply button enabled after calculation
   - [ ] Clicking Apply calls onSelect with complete data
   - [ ] Modal closes after selection

6. **ON_REQUEST Scenario**
   - [ ] "Price on Request" indicator shows
   - [ ] Apply button still enabled
   - [ ] Selection includes ON_REQUEST value

7. **Error Scenarios**
   - [ ] Network error shows error message
   - [ ] Invalid parameters show error
   - [ ] Apply button disabled on error

## Files Changed

- ✅ `src/components/admin/PackageSelector.tsx` - Enhanced
- ✅ `src/components/admin/__tests__/PackageSelector.test.tsx` - Updated
- ✅ `.kiro/specs/quote-package-price-integration/TASK_4_SUMMARY.md` - Created
- ✅ `.kiro/specs/quote-package-price-integration/TASK_4_VERIFICATION.md` - Created

## Conclusion

✅ **Task 4 is COMPLETE and ready for integration**

The PackageSelector component now:
- Returns complete PackageSelection data structure
- Includes full pricing details with breakdown
- Passes inclusions and accommodation examples
- Ensures price calculation completes before selection
- Properly handles loading states
- Maintains type safety throughout

The component is ready to be integrated with QuoteForm (Task 5) to enable atomic state updates and seamless price synchronization.
