When package pricing changes seasonally:

2. Recalculate quotes that haven't been sent
3. Contact customers for sent quotes
4. Document the seasonal change

### Version Tracking
Use version numbers to track quote evolution:

- Version 3: After customer negotiation
- etc.

### Custom Prices
If a quote has a custom price for a reason:
