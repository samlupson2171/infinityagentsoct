# Task 3: Database Connectivity Verification - Complete

## Summary

Task 3 has been completed with the following outcomes:

### ‚úÖ Subtask 3.2: Health Check Endpoint - COMPLETE

The health check endpoint already exists at `src/app/api/health/route.ts` and is fully functional.

**Features:**
- Tests database connectivity
- Validates environment variables
- Returns detailed status information
- Includes error handling and logging
- Provides feature status (database, email, AI content)

**Testing:**
```bash
# Local test
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Production test (after deployment)
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T21:55:45.751Z",
  "uptime": 90243.95543719,
  "database": {
    "status": "connected",
    "error": null
  },
  "environment": {
    "nodeEnv": "development",

### üìã Subtask 3.1: MongoDB Atlas Network Access - MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED

This subtask requires manual configuration in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. A comprehensive guide has been created to assist with this process.

**Created Resources:**
1. **MongoDB Atlas Setup Guide** - `.kiro/specs/enquiry-form-vercel-deployment/MONGODB_ATLAS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Step-by-step instructions for configuring network access
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Security best practices
   - Verification checklist

2. **Database Connection Verification Script** - `verify-database-connection.js`
   - Tests MongoDB connection
   - Validates read/write operations
   - Provides detailed diagnostics
   - Color-coded output for easy reading

**How to Use the Verification Script:**

```bash
# Test locally
export MONGODB_URI="your-connection-string"
node verify-database-connection.js

# Or load from .env.local
export $(grep -E "^MONGODB_URI=" .env.local | xargs)
node verify-database-connection.js
```

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Local database connection: **WORKING**
- ‚úÖ Read operations: **WORKING**
- ‚úÖ Write operations: **WORKING**
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint: **WORKING**

## MongoDB Atlas Configuration Steps

To complete subtask 3.1, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure Network Access

1. Log into [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Navigate to **Network Access** (under Security)
3. Click **"+ ADD IP ADDRESS"**
4. Click **"ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE"**
5. This adds `0.0.0.0/0` to the IP whitelist
6. Add comment: "Vercel deployment access"
7. Click **"Confirm"**

**Why 0.0.0.0/0?**
- Vercel uses dynamic IPs for serverless functions
- This is safe when combined with strong authentication
- Alternative: Add specific Vercel IP ranges (more maintenance)

### 2. Verify Database User

1. Navigate to **Database Access** (under Security)
2. Find your database user (from `MONGODB_URI`)
3. Verify permissions:
   - Role: `readWrite` on your database
   - Or custom role with read/write access
4. Ensure password is correct

### 3. Verify Connection String

Your `MONGODB_URI` should look like:
```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**Current connection string format:** ‚úÖ Valid
- Username: samlupson
- Cluster: infinagent.1pgp6zc.mongodb.net
- Database: infinityweekends

### 4. Set Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add/update `MONGODB_URI`
4. Set for all environments: Production, Preview, Development
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Trigger new deployment

### 5. Test on Vercel

After deployment:
```bash
# Test health check
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health

# Check database status in response
# Should show: "database": { "status": "connected" }
```

## Verification Results

### Local Environment ‚úÖ

```
‚úì MONGODB_URI environment variable is set
‚úì Successfully connected to MongoDB
‚úì Found 22 collections
‚úì Successfully read from collection
‚úì Successfully wrote test document
‚úì Successfully deleted test document
‚úì Database connection is working correctly
```

**Collections Found:**
- users, super_offer_packages, settings, enquiries
- activitypackages, filestorages, events, migrations
- trainingmaterials, quotes, activities, auditlogs
- offers, emailtrackings, contracttemplates
- importhistories, super_offer_package_history
- contactinfos, destinations, categories, contractsignatures

### Production Environment (Vercel)

**Status:** Pending manual MongoDB Atlas configuration

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete MongoDB Atlas network access configuration
2. Verify `MONGODB_URI` is set in Vercel
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Test health check endpoint on production
5. Verify events API endpoints work on production

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue: Connection Timeout**
- Cause: IP not whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Solution: Add `0.0.0.0/0` to Network Access
- Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to propagate

**Issue: Authentication Failed**
- Cause: Incorrect credentials or permissions
- Solution: Verify username/password in Database Access
- Check user has `readWrite` role
- URL-encode special characters in password

**Issue: Database Not Found**
- Cause: Database name mismatch
- Solution: Verify database name in MongoDB Atlas
- Update `MONGODB_URI` with correct name

## Security Considerations

‚úÖ **Implemented:**
- Strong database password
- User with limited permissions (readWrite only)
- Connection string stored in environment variables
- No credentials in source code

‚ö†Ô∏è **Recommendations:**
- Rotate database password periodically
- Monitor MongoDB Atlas logs for suspicious activity
- Use MongoDB Atlas IP Access List (0.0.0.0/0 is acceptable with strong auth)
- Enable MongoDB Atlas audit logs for compliance

   - Already implemented and working

## Next Steps

1. **Complete MongoDB Atlas Configuration** (Manual)
   - Follow the MongoDB Atlas Setup Guide
   - Configure network access to allow Vercel connections
   - Verify database user permissions

2. **Proceed to Task 4: Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel
   - Verify `MONGODB_URI` is correctly configured
   - Set variables for all environments

3. **Deploy and Test**
   - Push changes to trigger Vercel deployment
   - Test health check endpoint on production
   - Verify events API endpoints work
   - Check enquiry form events section loads

## Completion Checklist

- [x] Health check endpoint exists and works locally
- [x] Database connection verification script created
- [x] MongoDB Atlas setup guide created
- [x] Local database connection verified
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas network access configured (Manual step)
- [ ] Vercel environment variables set (Task 4)
- [ ] Production health check verified (Task 6)
- [ ] Events API working on production (Task 6)

## Conclusion

Task 3 is functionally complete from a code perspective. The health check endpoint is working, and the database connection is verified locally. The remaining step (3.1) requires manual configuration in MongoDB Atlas, which should be done before deploying to Vercel.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Code Complete | ‚è≥ Manual Configuration Pending

**Recommendation:** Proceed with MongoDB Atlas configuration using the provided guide, then move to Task 4 to verify all environment variables are set in Vercel.
