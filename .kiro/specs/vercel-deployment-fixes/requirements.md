# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is failing to deploy on Vercel due to three critical issues: environment validation errors, Next.js static generation attempting to render dynamic API routes, and MongoDB connection problems during the build process. This feature will resolve these deployment blockers to enable successful production deployment on Vercel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Environment Validation for Production

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the environment validator to work correctly in production environments, so that the build process doesn't fail due to false positive security warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is building in a production environment (Vercel) THEN the environment validator SHALL skip credential pattern checks for properly configured MongoDB Atlas connection strings
2. WHEN MONGODB_URI contains a MongoDB Atlas connection string with credentials THEN the validator SHALL recognize it as a valid production configuration
3. WHEN the environment validator runs during Vercel build THEN it SHALL NOT block the build process with false positive warnings
4. IF environment validation detects actual security issues THEN it SHALL log warnings without failing the build

### Requirement 2: Configure API Routes for Dynamic Rendering

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API routes to be properly configured for dynamic rendering, so that Next.js doesn't attempt to statically generate them during build time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Next.js builds the application THEN all API routes SHALL be marked for dynamic rendering
2. WHEN an API route uses `cookies()`, `headers()`, or `request.url` THEN it SHALL have the appropriate runtime configuration
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN no API routes SHALL throw "Dynamic server usage" errors
4. IF an API route requires authentication THEN it SHALL be configured with `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

### Requirement 3: Prevent MongoDB Connection During Build

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MongoDB connections to be skipped during the build phase, so that the build doesn't fail due to database connection timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is in build mode THEN MongoDB connection attempts SHALL be deferred
2. WHEN environment validators run during build THEN they SHALL NOT attempt to connect to MongoDB
3. WHEN the build process completes THEN it SHALL succeed without requiring database connectivity
4. IF the application starts in runtime mode THEN MongoDB connections SHALL be established normally

### Requirement 4: Fix Mongoose Schema Index Warnings

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate duplicate schema index warnings, so that the build logs are clean and don't mask real issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Mongoose schemas are defined THEN they SHALL NOT have duplicate index definitions
2. WHEN the application starts THEN no Mongoose duplicate index warnings SHALL appear in logs
3. WHEN schemas use indexes THEN they SHALL be defined only once per field
4. IF a field needs an index THEN it SHALL be defined either in the schema field definition OR via schema.index(), but not both
