# Enhanced Training Management Requirements

## Introduction

This specification enhances the existing training management system to provide better content creation and file management capabilities. The current system supports three types of training materials (Video, Blog/Content, Download) but has limitations in content creation and file handling. This enhancement will transform the Blog/Content type to use a WYSIWYG editor for rich content creation and upgrade the Download type to support actual file uploads instead of just URL references.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: WYSIWYG Content Editor for Blog/Content Materials

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to create rich blog/content materials using a WYSIWYG editor, so that I can format text, add images, and create engaging training content without needing external hosting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin selects "Blog/Content" type THEN the system SHALL display a WYSIWYG editor instead of a URL input field
2. WHEN using the WYSIWYG editor THEN the system SHALL support basic formatting (bold, italic, underline, headers, lists)
3. WHEN using the WYSIWYG editor THEN the system SHALL support image insertion and management
4. WHEN using the WYSIWYG editor THEN the system SHALL support link creation and editing
5. WHEN saving blog/content materials THEN the system SHALL store the rich content in the database
6. WHEN displaying blog/content materials THEN the system SHALL render the rich content with proper formatting
7. WHEN editing existing blog/content materials THEN the system SHALL load the content into the WYSIWYG editor for modification

### Requirement 2: File Upload System for Download Materials

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to upload files (images, PDFs, documents) for download materials, so that agents can access training resources directly without relying on external links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin selects "Download" type THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface instead of a URL input field
2. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL accept PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, JPG, PNG, and GIF file types
3. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL validate file size limits (maximum 10MB per file)
4. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL store files securely on the server
5. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL generate secure download URLs for agent access
6. WHEN displaying download materials THEN the system SHALL show file information (name, size, type)
7. WHEN agents access download materials THEN the system SHALL provide secure file download functionality
8. WHEN deleting download materials THEN the system SHALL remove associated files from storage

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Training Material Display

**User Story:** As an agent, I want to view training materials with improved presentation, so that I can easily consume video content, read formatted articles, and download resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing video materials THEN the system SHALL display embedded video players or direct links (existing functionality maintained)
2. WHEN viewing blog/content materials THEN the system SHALL render rich content with proper formatting and styling
3. WHEN viewing download materials THEN the system SHALL display file preview information and download buttons
4. WHEN accessing training materials THEN the system SHALL track material access for analytics
5. WHEN materials are inactive THEN the system SHALL hide them from agent view
6. WHEN viewing materials THEN the system SHALL display creation date and author information

### Requirement 4: File Management and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure file handling and storage, so that training materials are protected and system resources are managed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL scan for malicious content
2. WHEN files are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure file naming to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN files are accessed THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions
4. WHEN files are deleted THEN the system SHALL clean up storage to prevent orphaned files
5. WHEN storage limits are approached THEN the system SHALL notify administrators
6. WHEN files are served THEN the system SHALL use appropriate content-type headers
7. WHEN large files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide upload progress feedback

### Requirement 5: Content Migration and Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an admin, I want existing training materials to continue working while new features are available, so that current content remains accessible during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is upgraded THEN existing video materials SHALL continue to function unchanged
2. WHEN the system is upgraded THEN existing blog materials with URLs SHALL remain accessible
3. WHEN the system is upgraded THEN existing download materials with URLs SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN editing legacy blog materials THEN admins SHALL have the option to convert URL-based content to rich content
5. WHEN editing legacy download materials THEN admins SHALL have the option to replace URLs with uploaded files
6. WHEN migrating content THEN the system SHALL preserve all metadata (creation date, author, status)
7. WHEN content migration fails THEN the system SHALL maintain original content and log errors

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Admin Interface

**User Story:** As an admin, I want an improved interface for managing training materials, so that I can efficiently create, edit, and organize content with the new capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating materials THEN the interface SHALL dynamically show appropriate input methods based on selected type
2. WHEN using the WYSIWYG editor THEN the interface SHALL provide toolbar with formatting options
3. WHEN uploading files THEN the interface SHALL show upload progress and file validation feedback
4. WHEN managing materials THEN the interface SHALL display content previews for quick identification
5. WHEN editing materials THEN the interface SHALL preserve unsaved changes with auto-save functionality
6. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL be responsive and work on mobile devices
7. WHEN errors occur THEN the interface SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
