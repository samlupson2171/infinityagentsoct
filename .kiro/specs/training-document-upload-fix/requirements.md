# Training Document Upload and Download Fix - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues with the training manager's document upload and download functionality. Users are unable to properly upload documents and subsequently download them after upload, indicating problems in the file handling pipeline.

## Glossary

- **Training System**: The admin interface component that manages training materials including videos, blogs, and downloadable documents
- **File Manager**: The component responsible for handling file uploads, storage, and retrieval
- **File Storage Model**: The database schema that tracks uploaded files and their metadata
- **Download Route**: The API endpoint that serves files to authenticated users
- **File Association**: The process of linking uploaded files to their parent training material

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: File Upload Reliability

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to upload documents to training materials so that agents can access them for training purposes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin uploads a file through the training manager, THE Training System SHALL store the file with correct path information in both the filesystem and database
2. WHEN a file upload completes successfully, THE Training System SHALL return complete file metadata including id, originalName, fileName, filePath, mimeType, size, and uploadedAt
3. WHEN a file is uploaded, THE Training System SHALL immediately associate it with the training material to prevent orphaned files
4. WHEN multiple files are uploaded sequentially, THE Training System SHALL handle each file independently without data corruption
5. WHEN a file upload fails, THE Training System SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure reason

### Requirement 2: File Download Functionality

**User Story:** As an admin or agent user, I want to download training documents so that I can access training materials offline

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the download button on a training document, THE Training System SHALL serve the file with correct MIME type and filename
2. WHEN the download route receives a file request, THE Training System SHALL resolve the file path correctly from the database filePath field
3. WHEN a file is not found on the filesystem, THE Training System SHALL return a 404 error with a descriptive message
4. WHEN an authenticated user requests a file download, THE Training System SHALL verify the file exists in the database before attempting filesystem access
5. WHEN a file download succeeds, THE Training System SHALL log the download event for analytics

### Requirement 3: File Path Consistency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want file paths to be consistent throughout the system so that files can be reliably located and served

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded, THE File Manager SHALL store the relative path from the public directory (e.g., "uploads/training/filename.pdf")
2. WHEN the download route resolves a file path, THE Training System SHALL correctly join the public directory path with the stored filePath
3. WHEN file metadata is returned to the client, THE Training System SHALL include the complete filePath for reference
4. WHEN a training material is saved with uploaded files, THE Training System SHALL validate that all file paths exist on the filesystem
5. WHEN file paths are stored in the database, THE Training System SHALL use forward slashes consistently regardless of operating system

### Requirement 4: File Association Integrity

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want uploaded files to be properly linked to training materials so that files are not lost or orphaned

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a training material is created with uploaded files, THE Training System SHALL associate all files with the material ID before returning success
2. WHEN a training material is updated with new files, THE Training System SHALL maintain associations for existing files and add new associations
3. WHEN a training material is deleted, THE Training System SHALL mark associated files as orphaned for cleanup
4. WHEN files are uploaded but the material creation fails, THE Training System SHALL mark files as orphaned for later cleanup
5. WHEN the system runs cleanup operations, THE Training System SHALL remove orphaned files older than 7 days

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want clear error messages when file operations fail so that I can understand and resolve issues

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file upload fails due to size limits, THE Training System SHALL return an error message indicating the maximum allowed size
2. WHEN a file upload fails due to invalid file type, THE Training System SHALL return an error message listing allowed file types
3. WHEN a file download fails due to missing file, THE Training System SHALL return a 404 error with the file ID
4. WHEN file validation fails, THE Training System SHALL return specific validation errors for each failed check
5. WHEN database operations fail during file operations, THE Training System SHALL rollback filesystem changes to maintain consistency
