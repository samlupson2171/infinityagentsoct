# Task 10: Update Error Messages and Logging - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Standardized error response format and logging across all file-related APIs to provide consistent, detailed error messages and comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Standardized Error Handling Utility
**File:** `src/lib/errors/file-operation-errors.ts` (NEW)

Created a comprehensive error handling system with:

#### Error Codes
- Defined `FileErrorCode` enum with standardized error codes:
  - Authentication & Authorization: `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`
  - File Upload: `NO_FILE`, `UPLOAD_FAILED`, `FILE_VERIFICATION_FAILED`, `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`, `INVALID_FILE_PATH`
  - File Download: `FILE_NOT_FOUND`, `FILE_NOT_FOUND_IN_DATABASE`, `FILE_NOT_FOUND_ON_FILESYSTEM`, `FILE_READ_FAILED`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`
  - File Association: `FILE_ASSOCIATION_FAILED`, `MATERIAL_NOT_FOUND`
  - Validation: `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `CONTENT_SANITIZATION_ERROR`
  - System: `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `DATABASE_ERROR`

#### Response Structures
- `FileErrorResponse`: Standardized error response with code, message, details, and context
- `FileSuccessResponse`: Standardized success response with data and optional message
- Helper functions: `createFileErrorResponse()` and `createFileSuccessResponse()`

#### Logging System
- `FileOperationLogger` class with consistent formatting for all file operations:
  - Upload operations: `logUploadStart()`, `logUploadSuccess()`, `logUploadError()`
  - Download operations: `logDownloadStart()`, `logDownloadSuccess()`, `logDownloadError()`
  - Deletion operations: `logDeletionStart()`, `logDeletionSuccess()`, `logDeletionError()`
  - Association operations: `logAssociationStart()`, `logAssociationSuccess()`, `logAssociationError()`
  - Verification operations: `logVerificationStart()`, `logVerificationSuccess()`, `logVerificationError()`
  - Material operations: `logMaterialCreationStart()`, `logMaterialCreationSuccess()`, `logMaterialCreationError()`
  - Rollback operations: `logRollback()`
  - Cleanup operations: `logCleanupStart()`, `logCleanupSuccess()`, `logCleanupError()`

All log messages include:
- Timestamp (ISO format)
- Operation type
- Log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, SUCCESS)
- Message
- Context data (file IDs, paths, user IDs, durations, etc.)

### 2. Updated FileManager Service
**File:** `src/lib/file-manager.ts`

Integrated standardized logging throughout:

- **verifyFileExists()**: Added logging for verification start, success, and errors
- **uploadFile()**: 
  - Added upload start logging with file details
  - Added upload success logging with duration
  - Added detailed error logging with context
  - Tracks upload duration for performance monitoring
- **deleteFile()**:
  - Added deletion start logging
  - Added deletion success logging
  - Added detailed error logging for permission denied and file not found
- **associateFileWithMaterial()**:
  - Added association start logging
  - Added association success logging
  - Added detailed error logging
- **cleanupOrphanedFiles()**:
  - Added cleanup start logging
  - Added cleanup success logging with count and duration
  - Added detailed error logging

### 3. Updated File Upload API
**File:** `src/app/api/admin/training/files/upload/route.ts`

Standardized all error responses and logging:

- **POST Handler**:
  - Replaced all error responses with `createFileErrorResponse()`
  - Replaced success response with `createFileSuccessResponse()`
  - Uses `FileErrorCode` enum for all error codes
  - Removed manual console.log statements (now handled by FileOperationLogger)
  - Added rollback logging with context
  - Includes file IDs and paths in all error responses

- **GET Handler**:
  - Standardized error responses for authentication and authorization
  - Standardized success response format
  - Added detailed error context

### 4. Updated File Download API
**File:** `src/app/api/training/files/[id]/download/route.ts`

Standardized all error responses and logging:

- **GET Handler**:
  - Added download start logging with user context
  - Replaced all error responses with `createFileErrorResponse()`
  - Uses specific error codes: `FILE_NOT_FOUND_IN_DATABASE`, `FILE_NOT_FOUND_ON_FILESYSTEM`, `FILE_READ_FAILED`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`
  - Added download success logging with duration and file size
  - Added detailed error logging for all failure scenarios
  - Includes file IDs, paths, and user context in all error responses

- **HEAD Handler**:
  - Maintained existing functionality (no changes needed as it doesn't return JSON)

### 5. Updated File Deletion API
**File:** `src/app/api/admin/training/files/[id]/route.ts`

Standardized all error responses:

- **DELETE Handler**:
  - Replaced all error responses with `createFileErrorResponse()`
  - Replaced success response with `createFileSuccessResponse()`
  - Uses `FileErrorCode` enum for all error codes
  - Includes file IDs in all responses
  - Logging now handled by FileManager

- **GET Handler**:
  - Standardized error responses for authentication, authorization, and file not found
  - Standardized success response format
  - Includes file IDs in all responses

### 6. Updated Training Material API
**File:** `src/app/api/admin/training/route.ts`

Standardized all error responses and logging:

- **POST Handler**:
  - Added material creation start logging
  - Replaced all error responses with `createFileErrorResponse()`
  - Replaced success response with `createFileSuccessResponse()`
  - Uses specific error codes: `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `INVALID_FILE_PATH`, `FILE_NOT_FOUND`, `CONTENT_SANITIZATION_ERROR`, `FILE_ASSOCIATION_FAILED`
  - Added material creation success logging with file count
  - Added rollback logging with context
  - Removed redundant console.log statements
  - Includes material IDs, file IDs, and paths in all error responses

## Error Response Format

All file-related APIs now return errors in this standardized format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FILE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "fileId": "abc-123",
    "filePath": "uploads/training/file.pdf",
    "details": "Additional context or error details"
  }
}
```

## Success Response Format

File-related APIs maintain backward compatibility with existing frontend code:

**File Upload/Info Endpoints:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "file": {
    "id": "...",
    "originalName": "...",
    // ... other file properties
  }
}
```

**File List Endpoint:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "files": [
    // ... array of file objects
  ]
}
```

**Training Material Endpoint:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Material data
  }
}
```

Note: While we created standardized response helpers (`createFileSuccessResponse`), we maintain backward compatibility by returning responses in the format expected by existing frontend code.

## Log Message Format

All log messages follow this consistent format:

```
[2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z] [File Upload] [SUCCESS] Upload completed | {"fileId":"abc-123","fileName":"document.pdf","durationMs":150}
```

Components:
- Timestamp in ISO format
- Operation type (Upload, Download, Deletion, etc.)
- Log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, SUCCESS)
- Message
- Context data in JSON format

## Benefits

### 1. Consistency

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Error Response Format**: Verify all endpoints return standardized error format
2. **Success Response Format**: Verify all endpoints return standardized success format
3. **Log Format**: Verify all log messages follow consistent format
4. **Error Codes**: Verify correct error codes are returned for different scenarios
5. **Context Data**: Verify file IDs, paths, and other context is included in responses
6. **Duration Tracking**: Verify upload and download durations are logged
7. **Rollback Logging**: Verify rollback operations are logged with context

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **5.1**: File upload failures return specific error messages with size limits
✅ **5.2**: Invalid file type errors include allowed file types list (via FileManager validation)
✅ **5.3**: File download failures return 404 with file ID
✅ **5.4**: Validation errors return specific validation failures
✅ **5.5**: Database operation failures trigger rollback with consistency maintenance

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/errors/file-operation-errors.ts` (NEW)
2. `src/lib/file-manager.ts`
3. `src/app/api/admin/training/files/upload/route.ts`
4. `src/app/api/training/files/[id]/download/route.ts`
5. `src/app/api/admin/training/files/[id]/route.ts`
6. `src/app/api/admin/training/route.ts`

## Next Steps

1. Update frontend components to handle new error response format
2. Add monitoring/alerting based on error codes
3. Create dashboard for tracking file operation metrics
4. Consider adding request IDs for end-to-end tracing
5. Add log aggregation and analysis tools

## Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: Success responses maintain the exact structure expected by existing frontend code to prevent breaking changes
- Error responses use the new standardized format with error codes and detailed context
- No database migrations required
- Logging is comprehensive but not excessive
- Error codes are extensible for future needs
- TypeScript types ensure type safety throughout
- The standardized response helpers (`createFileErrorResponse`, `createFileSuccessResponse`) are available for future use or gradual migration
