# Simple Email Solution - Implementation Complete

## Summary

The Infinity Weekends platform has been successfully migrated from Resend to a simple, reliable SMTP-based email solution using nodemailer. The system now supports any SMTP provider including Gmail, Microsoft 365, SendGrid, and custom SMTP servers.

## What Was Done

### 1. Verified Existing Implementation ✅
- Confirmed that `src/lib/email.ts` already had a complete SMTP implementation
- All required email functions were already present:
  - Registration confirmation emails
  - Admin notification emails
  - Approval notification emails
  - Rejection notification emails
  - Enquiry confirmation emails
  - Enquiry notification emails
  - Quote emails
  - Quote admin notification emails
  - Test email function

### 2. Removed Resend Dependencies ✅
- Deleted `src/lib/resend-email.ts` file
- Removed `resend` package from `package.json`
- Removed Resend environment variables from `.env.local`:
  - `RESEND_API_KEY`
  - `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
  - `RESEND_FROM_NAME`
  - `RESEND_TO_EMAIL`
  - `RESEND_TO_NAME`

### 3. Updated Environment Configuration ✅
- Updated `.env.example` with comprehensive SMTP configuration
- Removed all Resend references
- Added detailed comments and examples for common SMTP providers
- Kept existing SMTP configuration in `.env.local` (Microsoft 365)

### 4. Updated Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive `docs/smtp-email-setup-guide.md`
- Deleted `docs/resend-email-setup-guide.md`
- Included configuration examples for:
  - Gmail
  - Microsoft 365
  - SendGrid
  - Generic SMTP servers
- Added troubleshooting guide
- Added security best practices

## Current Email Configuration

The system is currently configured to use Microsoft 365 SMTP:

```env

SMTP_SECURE=false
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will remove the `resend` package that was deleted from package.json.

2. **Verify SMTP Configuration**
   - Ensure your `.env.local` has valid SMTP credentials
   - Test the configuration by starting the application
   - Check console for "Email server configuration verified successfully"

3. **Test Email Delivery**
   - Register a test user account
   - Check for registration confirmation email
   - Check admin inbox for notification email
   - Test quote email functionality

### Optional Improvements

1. **Set Up SPF/DKIM Records**
   - Configure SPF records for your domain
   - Set up DKIM signing
   - Improves email deliverability

2. **Monitor Email Delivery**
   - Track delivery success rate
   - Monitor retry rates
   - Set up alerts for failures

3. **Consider Email Queuing**
   - For high-volume scenarios
   - Implement background job processing
   - Use Redis or similar for queue management

## Configuration Examples

### Switch to Gmail

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-specific-password
```

### Switch to SendGrid

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASS=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

### Use Custom SMTP Server

```env
SMTP_HOST=mail.yourdomain.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=noreply@yourdomain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-password
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Emails Aren't Sending

1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify SMTP credentials are valid
3. Check application logs for error messages
4. Test SMTP connection: `telnet smtp.office365.com 587`
5. Ensure firewall allows outbound SMTP connections

### If Emails Go to Spam

1. Set up SPF records for your domain
2. Set up DKIM signing
3. Use a verified domain email address
4. Avoid spam trigger words in subject lines

### Common Errors

- **"Email configuration is incomplete"**: Missing SMTP environment variables
- **"Authentication failed"**: Invalid credentials or 2FA issues
- **"Connection timeout"**: Firewall blocking or incorrect host

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Simplicity**: No third-party API dependencies
2. **Flexibility**: Works with any SMTP provider
3. **Reliability**: Industry-standard SMTP protocol
4. **Cost-Effective**: Use existing email service
5. **Control**: Full control over email delivery
6. **Privacy**: No data shared with third-party services
