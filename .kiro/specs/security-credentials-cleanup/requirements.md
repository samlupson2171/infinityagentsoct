# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security vulnerabilities in the Infinity Weekends codebase where MongoDB connection strings containing credentials are hardcoded in various files outside of environment configuration files. This prevents the project from being safely uploaded to GitHub and poses significant security risks. The solution will systematically identify, remove, and replace all hardcoded credentials with proper environment variable references.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all hardcoded MongoDB connection strings removed from the codebase, so that sensitive credentials are not exposed in version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all files containing hardcoded MongoDB connection strings with the pattern `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/`
2. WHEN hardcoded credentials are found THEN the system SHALL replace them with environment variable references
3. WHEN credentials are replaced THEN the system SHALL ensure the corresponding environment variables exist in .env.example
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN no files SHALL contain hardcoded MongoDB credentials except for .env files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized approach to database connection management, so that all database access uses secure environment variable configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use environment variables exclusively
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which variables are required
3. WHEN connection strings are constructed THEN the system SHALL validate that no credentials are hardcoded
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL verify all required environment variables are present

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of environment variable requirements, so that deployment and development setup is clear and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN developers SHALL have clear documentation of all required environment variables
2. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL provide validation that all security-sensitive variables are properly configured
3. WHEN environment variables are updated THEN the .env.example file SHALL reflect the current requirements
4. WHEN credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL provide secure methods for obtaining and configuring them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want automated validation to prevent future credential leaks, so that hardcoded credentials cannot be accidentally committed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL validate that no hardcoded credentials are present
2. WHEN MongoDB connection strings are added THEN the system SHALL enforce environment variable usage
3. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on proper credential management
4. WHEN the codebase is scanned THEN the system SHALL generate reports of any potential security issues
