# Email Fix Complete - Code Issues Resolved

## What I Fixed

I found and fixed **3 critical bugs** in `src/lib/email.ts` where functions were trying to use `transporter` directly instead of calling `getTransporter()` or using the retry mechanism:

### Fixed Functions:
1. ✅ `sendRejectionNotificationEmail()` - Now uses `sendEmailWithRetry()`
2. ✅ `sendEnquiryNotificationEmail()` - Now uses `sendEmailWithRetry()`  
3. ✅ `sendEnquiryConfirmationEmail()` - Now uses `sendEmailWithRetry()`

These functions were calling `transporter.sendMail()` directly, but `transporter` was `null` until `getTransporter()` was called. This would cause a "Cannot read property 'sendMail' of null" error.

## The Authentication Issue

However, there's still a **GoDaddy authentication error (535)** that's separate from the code bugs:

```
535 Authentication Failed for agents@infinityagents.co.uk
```

## Since Emails Were Working Before...

You mentioned emails were working fine previously. Here's what might have changed:

### Possible Causes:

1. **Password Changed**
   - Someone changed the password in GoDaddy
   - The `.env.local` file has the old password
   - **Fix**: Update `SMTP_PASS` in `.env.local` with the current password

2. **GoDaddy Account Security Change**
   - GoDaddy enabled 2FA on the account
   - GoDaddy disabled SMTP access for security
   - Account was flagged for suspicious activity
   - **Fix**: Log into GoDaddy and check security settings

3. **IP Address Blocked**
   - Your IP changed and GoDaddy blocked it
   - Too many failed login attempts
   - **Fix**: Contact GoDaddy support to whitelist your IP

4. **Account Billing Issue**
   - Email service expired or suspended
   - Payment failed
   - **Fix**: Check GoDaddy billing status

5. **Environment Variable Issue**
   - `.env.local` file was modified
   - Password has special characters that need escaping
   - **Fix**: Verify the password is exactly correct

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Verify Password
Try logging into GoDaddy webmail:
- Go to: https://email.secureserver.net/
- Email: `agents@infinityagents.co.uk`
- Password: `5tgbVFR$edc`

**If webmail login fails** → Password is wrong, reset it in GoDaddy
**If webmail login works** → Password is correct, issue is with SMTP access

### Step 2: Check GoDaddy Account
1. Log into https://account.godaddy.com/
2. Go to **Email & Office** → **Workspace Email**
3. Click on `agents@infinityagents.co.uk`
4. Check:
   - ✅ Account is Active (not suspended)
   - ✅ SMTP/POP access is Enabled
   - ✅ No security alerts or holds
   - ✅ Billing is current

### Step 3: Try Alternative Port
If port 465 doesn't work, try port 587:

Edit `.env.local`:
```env
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
```

Then test:
```bash
node test-godaddy-smtp-simple.js
```

### Step 4: Check for Recent Changes
Think about what changed since emails last worked:
- Did you update any packages? (`npm update`)
- Did you change the `.env.local` file?
- Did you deploy to a new server/environment?
- Did GoDaddy send any security emails?

## What's Working Now

✅ **Code bugs fixed** - All email functions now properly use the transporter
✅ **SMTP connection works** - Server responds correctly
✅ **Configuration is correct** - Host, port, and format are all valid
❌ **Authentication fails** - GoDaddy is rejecting the credentials

## Next Steps

1. **Verify the password** by logging into GoDaddy webmail
2. **Check GoDaddy account** for any security or billing issues
3. **Enable SMTP access** if it was disabled
4. **Contact GoDaddy support** if the above doesn't work

## Testing After Fix

Once you resolve the authentication issue, test with:

```bash
node test-godaddy-smtp-simple.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ SMTP Connection Successful!
✅ Test email sent successfully!
```

Then all your application emails will work:
- Registration confirmations
- Admin notifications
- Approval emails
- Quote emails
- Enquiry notifications

---

**The code is now fixed. The remaining issue is with GoDaddy account authentication, which requires checking your GoDaddy account settings or contacting their support.**
