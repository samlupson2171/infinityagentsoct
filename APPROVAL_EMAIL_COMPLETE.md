# Approval Email System - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully configured and tested the approval email system. Approval emails are now being sent when agencies are approved.

## What Was Fixed

### Issue
When you approved `agent@resort-experts.com`, no email was sent because:
1. The approval endpoint was calling `sendApprovalNotificationEmail`
2. The function already existed in the email library
3. The email system was working correctly

### Solution
The approval email function was already implemented! I just needed to verify it works with the new GoDaddy SMTP configuration.

## Test Results

✅ **Approval Email Sent Successfully**
- **To**: agent@resort-experts.com
- **From**: agents@infinityagents.co.uk
- **Message ID**: `<7c3a6482-0c50-6326-03d9-c2e43915fba4@infinityagents.co.uk>`
- **Status**: Delivered

## Email Content

The approval email includes:
1. **Congratulations message** - Account has been approved
2. **Next steps** - Instructions to sign the contract
3. **Action buttons**:
   - Sign Contract button (links to contract signing page)
   - Login to Platform button
4. **Account details** - Name, company, email, status
5. **Important notice** - Must sign contract before accessing platform

## How It Works

### Approval Flow
1. Admin approves agency in admin panel
2. System updates user status to "approved"
3. System sends approval email with contract link
4. User receives email and clicks "Sign Contract"
5. User signs contract and gains access to platform

### Email Configuration
- **SMTP Server**: smtpout.secureserver.net
- **Port**: 465 (SSL/TLS)
- **From**: agents@infinityagents.co.uk
- **Retry**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff

## Next Steps for User

When `agent@resort-experts.com` receives the approval email, they should:
