# Fix: Super Packages API Returning 404

## Problem
The error `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON` means the API is returning an HTML 404 page instead of JSON data.

## Root Cause
Next.js is not recognizing the API route at `/api/admin/super-packages`. This typically happens when:
1. The dev server needs to be restarted
2. There's a build cache issue
3. The route file isn't being picked up

## Solution

### Step 1: Restart the Development Server
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: If that doesn't work, clear Next.js cache
```bash
# Stop the server first, then:
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify the API route is accessible
Once the server restarts, test the API directly by visiting:
```
http://localhost:3002/api/admin/super-packages?status=all&limit=10
```

You should see JSON data, not an HTML page.

### Step 4: Check browser console
After restarting, go to `/admin/super-packages` and check:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Look for the request to `/api/admin/super-packages`
4. Check the response - it should be JSON, not HTML

## Why This Happens

Next.js uses file-based routing for API routes. The route file exists at:
```
src/app/api/admin/super-packages/route.ts
```

But sometimes Next.js doesn't pick up new routes or changes until the dev server is restarted. This is especially common when:
- Routes are added while the server is running
- There are TypeScript compilation errors (even if they're fixed)
- The `.next` build cache gets corrupted

## Expected Result

After restarting, you should see:
- 5 packages listed on the page
- All named "Albufeira 2026"
- Status badges showing "Active"
- Action buttons (Edit, Duplicate, etc.)

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check that you're logged in as an admin user
2. Verify your MongoDB connection is working
3. Check the server console for any errors
4. Try accessing the debug page: `/admin/super-packages/debug`
