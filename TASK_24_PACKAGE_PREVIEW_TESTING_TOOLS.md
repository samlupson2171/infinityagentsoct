# Task 24: Package Preview and Testing Tools Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a standalone price calculator page that allows administrators to test price calculations for super offer packages without creating quotes. This provides a comprehensive preview of package details, pricing matrix, inclusions, and real-time price calculations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. PackagePriceCalculator Component
**File:** `src/components/admin/PackagePriceCalculator.tsx`

A comprehensive React component that provides:

#### Features:
- **Package Selection**: Dropdown to select from active packages
- **Package Details Display**: Shows destination, resort, currency, available group sizes, and durations
- **Price Calculation Form**: 
  - Number of people input
  - Duration selection (from available options)
  - Arrival date picker
- **Real-time Price Calculation**: Calculates price based on parameters
- **Pricing Matrix Display**: Full spreadsheet-like view of all prices
- **Inclusions Display**: Lists all package inclusions with checkmarks
- **Accommodation Examples**: Shows example properties
- **Sales Notes**: Displays internal sales notes
- **Currency Formatting**: Proper formatting for EUR, GBP, USD

#### Calculation Results:
- Shows selected tier and period
- Displays per-person price
- Calculates total price (per-person × number of people)
- Handles "ON REQUEST" pricing scenarios
- Shows detailed breakdown

#### Props:
```typescript
interface PackagePriceCalculatorProps {
  packageData?: ISuperOfferPackage;  // Optional pre-selected package
  onPackageSelect?: (packageId: string) => void;  // Callback when package selected
}
```

### 2. Calculator Page
**File:** `src/app/admin/super-packages/calculator/page.tsx`

A dedicated admin page for the price calculator:

#### Features:
- Clean, focused interface for testing
- Back button to return to packages list
- Help section with usage instructions
- Note explaining this is for testing purposes only
- Responsive layout with proper spacing

#### Route:
`/admin/super-packages/calculator`

### 3. Integration with SuperPackageManager
**File:** `src/components/admin/SuperPackageManager.tsx`

Added a "Price Calculator" button to the main packages manager:
- Purple button with calculator icon
- Positioned alongside Import and Create buttons
- Direct navigation to calculator page

### 4. API Integration
The calculator uses existing API endpoints:
- `GET /api/admin/super-packages` - Load active packages
- `POST /api/admin/super-packages/calculate-price` - Calculate prices

### 5. Tests
**Files:**
- `src/components/admin/__tests__/PackagePriceCalculator.test.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/super-packages/calculator/__tests__/page.test.tsx`

#### Test Coverage:
- Package selection and loading
- Package details display
- Price calculation with various parameters
- ON_REQUEST handling
- Error handling
- Pricing matrix display
- Inclusions and accommodation display
- Currency formatting (EUR, GBP, USD)
- Form input handling
- Loading states
- Callback props

## User Workflow

### Testing a Package Price:
