# AI Content Generation Flow Debug Guide

## Issue
AI content is generated successfully, but when clicking "Accept", the content is not being saved to the relevant sections.

## Debug Steps Added

### 1. Added Logging to DestinationContentEditor
- Added console logs in `handleAIContentGenerated` to track:
  - What content is received from AI generator
  - Which sections are being processed
  - What data is being passed to `onSectionUpdate`

### 2. Added Logging to Edit Page
- Added console logs in `handleSectionUpdate` to track:
  - What section data is being received
  - What is being sent to the API
  - API response status and data

## How to Debug

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Navigate to a destination edit page
4. Switch to the "Content & Sections" tab
5. Click the AI Content Generator button (sparkles icon)
6. Generate content for some sections
7. Accept the generated content by clicking "Accept" on each section
8. Click "Apply Selected Content"
9. Watch the console for debug messages

## Expected Flow

1. `🤖 AI Content Generated:` - Shows the processed content from AI
2. `📝 Processing section [name]:` - Shows each section being processed
3. `💾 Saving section [name]:` - Shows the section data being saved
4. `🔄 Updating section [name]:` - Shows the API call being made
5. `📤 Sending update request with sections:` - Shows the data being sent to API
6. `✅ Section update successful:` - Shows successful API response

## Potential Issues to Look For

1. **Missing sections**: If you see `⚠️ Section [name] not found in existing sections`
2. **API errors**: If you see `❌ Section update failed:` or `❌ Error updating section:`
3. **Empty content**: Check if the AI-generated content is actually populated
4. **Network issues**: Check if the API calls are being made successfully

## Quick Fix Test

If the issue persists, try manually refreshing the page after applying AI content to see if the content was actually saved to the database.
