## Verification Steps

### âœ… Sub-task 1: Show package reference in quote list

**What to check:**

- Badge is visually distinct and easy to identify
- Package name is clearly readable

---

### âœ… Sub-task 2: Display linked package indicator

**What to check:**
- Package indicator in list view (covered above)
- "Linked to Package" badge in detail modal's Package Details section

**Expected behavior:**
- Clear visual distinction between package-based and manual quotes
- Consistent styling across all views

---

### âœ… Sub-task 3: Add package details in quote view

**What to check:**
- Click "View Details" on a quote with a linked package
- Look for "Linked Super Package" section (should appear before "Package Details")
- Section should display:
  - Package name with ðŸ“¦ emoji
  - Package version number
  - "View Package â†’" link (opens in new tab)
  - Group Size Tier label
  - Duration in nights
  - Pricing Period
  - Calculated Price (formatted with currency)
  - Informational message about package-based quote

**Expected behavior:**
- All package information is clearly displayed

### âœ… Sub-task 4: Show pricing tier and period used

**What to check:**
- In the "Linked Super Package" section of quote details
- Look for "Group Size Tier" field
- Look for "Pricing Period" field
- Look for "Calculated Price" field

**Expected behavior:**
- Tier label displays correctly (e.g., "6-11 People")
- Period displays correctly (e.g., "June 2025")
- Price displays with proper currency formatting
- If price was "ON REQUEST", shows "ON REQUEST (Manual Entry)" in orange

## Requirements Verification

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 10.1: Show package reference in quote list | âœ… | Badge displays package name |
| 10.2: Display link to view full package details | âœ… | "View Package â†’" link in modal |
| 10.3: Show pricing tier and period used | âœ… | Both displayed in package section |
| 10.4: Indicate if manually created vs package-based | âœ… | Informational message included |

## Edge Cases Handled

- âœ… Quotes without linked packages (no package section shown)
- âœ… ON REQUEST pricing (special indicator displayed)
- âœ… Missing package data (graceful handling)
- âœ… Long package names (proper text wrapping)

## Code Quality Checks

- âœ… TypeScript compilation: No errors
- âœ… Consistent code style: Matches existing patterns
- âœ… Proper conditional rendering: Uses optional chaining
- âœ… Accessibility: Semantic HTML and proper labels
- âœ… Responsive design: Grid layout adapts to screen size

## Integration Verification

To fully verify the implementation works end-to-end:

1. **Create a Super Package** (if not already done)
   - Go to `/admin/super-packages`
   - Create or import a package

2. **Create a Quote from Package**
   - Go to `/admin/quotes`
   - Click "Create Quote"
   - Use "Select Super Package" feature
   - Complete the quote creation

3. **Verify Display**
   - Return to quote list
   - Confirm package badge appears
   - Click "View Details"
   - Confirm all package information displays correctly

## Screenshots Locations

For visual verification, check these UI elements:

1. **Quote List Table**
   - Location: Below quote reference and lead name
   - Element: Indigo badge with package name

2. **Quote Details Modal**
   - Location: After quote header, before package details
   - Element: "Linked Super Package" section with border

3. **Package Details Section**

   - Element: "Linked to Package" badge among other badges
