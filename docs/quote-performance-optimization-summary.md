#### Monitoring Dashboard
- **System Overview**: Real-time health metrics and status indicators
- **Performance Analytics**: Operation breakdowns and timing analysis
- **Email Delivery Tracking**: Visual representation of delivery success
- **Error Monitoring**: Error rate trends and failure analysis

#### Alerting System
- **Configurable Alerts**: Customizable thresholds for different metrics
- **Alert Types**:
  - Email failure rate alerts (>10% threshold)
  - Database slow query alerts (>5s threshold)
  - Cache miss rate alerts (>80% threshold)
  - General error rate alerts (>5% threshold)
- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Email, console, and extensible to Slack/Teams
