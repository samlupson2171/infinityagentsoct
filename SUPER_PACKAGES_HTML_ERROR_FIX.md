# Super Packages "Unexpected token '<'" Error Fix

## Error
```
Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

## What This Means
The API is returning an HTML page (likely a 404 or error page) instead of JSON. This happens when:
1. The API route isn't being recognized by Next.js
2. There's a server-side error
3. The route needs to be recompiled

## Solution

### Step 1: Restart the Development Server
This is the most common fix. Next.js needs to recompile the API routes.

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
I've added detailed logging to both pages. After restarting:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try clicking "Edit" or "View" on a package
4. Look for these console logs:
   - `Fetching package: [id]`
   - `URL: /api/admin/super-packages/[id]`
   - `Response status: [number]`
   - `Response content-type: [type]`

### Step 3: What to Look For

**If you see:**
- `Response status: 404` → The API route isn't being found
- `Response status: 500` → There's a server error (check terminal)
- `Response content-type: text/html` → Confirms it's returning HTML instead of JSON
- `Response content-type: application/json` → Good! The API is responding

### Step 4: Common Fixes

#### Fix 1: Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

#### Fix 2: Check the Terminal
Look for any errors in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running. There might be:
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Import errors
- Database connection issues

#### Fix 3: Verify the Route
The API route should be at: `src/app/api/admin/super-packages/[id]/route.ts`

Check that:
- The file exists ✓
- It exports GET, PUT, DELETE functions ✓
- There are no syntax errors ✓

## Files Modified

Added detailed error logging to:
1. `src/app/admin/super-packages/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
2. `src/app/admin/super-packages/[id]/page.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your dev server** (most important!)
2. **Check the console logs** to see what's actually happening
3. **Check the terminal** for any server errors
4. **Report back** with the console output if it still doesn't work

## Expected Console Output (Success)

```
Fetching package: 68e980fb51b3f83e06b8d706
URL: /api/admin/super-packages/68e980fb51b3f83e06b8d706
Response status: 200
Response content-type: application/json
Success data: { success: true, data: { package: {...}, linkedQuotesCount: 0 } }
```

## Expected Console Output (Error)

```
Fetching package: 68e980fb51b3f83e06b8d706
URL: /api/admin/super-packages/68e980fb51b3f83e06b8d706
Response status: 404
Response content-type: text/html
Error response: <!DOCTYPE html>...
```

This will tell us exactly what's wrong!
