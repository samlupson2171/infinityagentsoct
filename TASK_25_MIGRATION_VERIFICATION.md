## Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Sub-task 1: Execute Migration to Create super_offer_packages Collection

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation Details:
- Created migration script: `scripts/run-super-packages-migration.js`
- Migration creates `super_offer_packages` collection with full schema validation
- Schema validation includes:
  - Required fields: name, destination, resort, currency, groupSizeTiers, durationOptions, pricingMatrix, status, version, createdBy, lastModifiedBy
  - Enum validation for currency (EUR, GBP, USD) and status (active, inactive, deleted)
  - Array validation for groupSizeTiers, durationOptions, and pricingMatrix
  - Nested object validation for pricing structure
  - Type validation for all fields

### Verification:
```bash
npm run migrate:super-packages
```

**Output:**
```
✓ Created super_offer_packages collection
✓ Created 5 indexes
✓ Created super_offer_package_history collection
✓ Created linkedPackage.packageId index
✓ Migration recorded
```

### Test Results:
- ✅ Collection created successfully
- ✅ Schema validation applied
- ✅ Migration recorded in database
- ✅ No errors during creation

---

## Sub-task 2: Verify All Indexes Created Successfully

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Indexes Created on super_offer_packages:

1. **status_destination_idx**
   - Keys: `{ status: 1, destination: 1 }`
   - Purpose: Efficient filtering by status and destination
   - Status: ✅ Created

2. **created_at_desc_idx**
   - Keys: `{ createdAt: -1 }`
   - Purpose: Sorting by creation date (newest first)
   - Status: ✅ Created

3. **name_destination_text_idx**
   - Keys: Text index on name and destination
   - Purpose: Full-text search functionality
   - Status: ✅ Created

4. **name_idx**
   - Keys: `{ name: 1 }`
   - Purpose: Fast name lookups
   - Status: ✅ Created

5. **resort_idx**
   - Keys: `{ resort: 1 }`
   - Purpose: Filtering by resort
   - Status: ✅ Created

### Indexes Created on super_offer_package_history:

1. **package_version_idx**
   - Keys: `{ packageId: 1, version: -1 }`
   - Purpose: Efficient version history queries
   - Status: ✅ Created

2. **modified_at_desc_idx**
   - Keys: `{ modifiedAt: -1 }`
   - Purpose: Sorting by modification date
   - Status: ✅ Created

### Verification Command:
```bash
npm run migrate:super-packages:verify
```

**Output:**
```
Indexes on super_offer_packages:
✓ status_destination_idx
  Keys: {"status":1,"destination":1}
✓ created_at_desc_idx
  Keys: {"createdAt":-1}
✓ name_destination_text_idx
  Keys: {"_fts":"text","_ftsx":1}
✓ name_idx
  Keys: {"name":1}
✓ resort_idx
  Keys: {"resort":1}

Indexes on super_offer_package_history:
✓ package_version_idx
  Keys: {"packageId":1,"version":-1}
✓ modified_at_desc_idx
  Keys: {"modifiedAt":-1}
```

### Test Results:
- ✅ All 5 indexes created on super_offer_packages
- ✅ All 2 indexes created on super_offer_package_history
- ✅ Index keys match design specifications
- ✅ Text index properly configured for search

---

## Sub-task 3: Add linkedPackage Field to Quotes Collection

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation Details:
- Added sparse index on `linkedPackage.packageId` field
- Sparse index only indexes documents that have the linkedPackage field
- Enables efficient queries for quotes linked to specific packages
- Does not affect existing quotes without linkedPackage

### Index Details:
- **Name**: `linked_package_id_idx`
- **Keys**: `{ 'linkedPackage.packageId': 1 }`
- **Options**: `{ sparse: true }`
- **Purpose**: Fast lookups of quotes by linked package

### Verification:
```bash
npm run migrate:super-packages:verify
```

**Output:**
```
Indexes on quotes collection (linkedPackage):
✓ linked_package_id_idx
  Keys: {"linkedPackage.packageId":1}
  Sparse: true
```

### Test Results:
- ✅ Index created on quotes collection
- ✅ Sparse option properly set
- ✅ Existing quotes unaffected
- ✅ Index ready for package linking

---

## Sub-task 4: Test Migration Rollback Procedure

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation Details:
- Created rollback script: `scripts/rollback-super-packages-migration.js`
- Rollback performs operations in reverse order:
  1. Drops linkedPackage index from quotes
  2. Drops super_offer_package_history collection
  3. Drops super_offer_packages collection
  4. Removes migration record
- Includes safety checks and confirmation prompts
- Verifies rollback completion

### Rollback Test Procedure:

1. **Initial State Verification**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:super-packages:verify
   ```
   Result: ✅ Migration applied, all collections and indexes present

2. **Execute Rollback**
   ```bash
   echo "yes" | npm run migrate:super-packages:rollback
   ```
   
   **Output:**
   ```
   ✓ Dropped linkedPackage index from quotes
   ✓ Dropped super_offer_package_history collection
   ✓ Dropped super_offer_packages collection
   ✓ Removed migration record
   ```

3. **Verify Rollback**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:super-packages:verify
   ```
   
   **Output:**
   ```
   Migration 008: Not applied ✗
   ✗ super_offer_packages
   ✗ super_offer_package_history
   ✗ linked_package_id_idx (not found)
   ```

4. **Re-apply Migration**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:super-packages
   ```
   Result: ✅ Migration successfully re-applied

5. **Final Verification**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:super-packages:verify
   ```
   Result: ✅ All collections and indexes present

### Test Results:
- ✅ Rollback script executes without errors
- ✅ All collections properly dropped
- ✅ All indexes properly removed
- ✅ Migration record removed
- ✅ Rollback can be verified
- ✅ Migration can be re-applied after rollback
- ✅ Idempotent operations (can run multiple times safely)
