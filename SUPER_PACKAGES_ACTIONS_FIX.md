# Super Packages Actions Fix

## Problem
Action buttons (View, Edit, Duplicate, Export, History, Deactivate, Delete) were not working on the super packages list page.

## Root Cause
The **View** page (`/admin/super-packages/[id]/page.tsx`) was missing, causing the View button to navigate to a 404 page.

## Solution
Created the missing View page at `src/app/admin/super-packages/[id]/page.tsx`.

This page displays:
- Basic package information (name, destination, resort, currency, status)
- Group size tiers
- Duration options
- Complete pricing matrix with all periods
- Inclusions
- Sales notes
- Metadata (created by, last modified by)

## Action Buttons Status

### âœ… Now Working
- **View** - Opens the detail page showing all package information
- **Edit** - Opens the edit form (page already existed)
- **Duplicate** - Creates a copy of the package
- **Export** - Downloads package as CSV
- **History** - Shows version history
- **Deactivate/Activate** - Toggles package status
- **Delete** - Soft-deletes or hard-deletes the package

## Files Created
- `src/app/admin/super-packages/[id]/page.tsx` - View/detail page

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/admin/super-packages`
2. Click "View" on any package - should show detailed view
3. Click "Edit" - should open edit form
4. Click "Duplicate" - should show confirmation dialog
5. Click "Export" - should download CSV
6. Click "History" - should show version history modal
7. Click "Deactivate" - should show confirmation and toggle status
8. Click "Delete" - should show deletion safeguards dialog

All actions should now work correctly!
