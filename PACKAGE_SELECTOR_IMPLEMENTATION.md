# PackageSelector Component Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Task 11: "Build PackageSelector component for quote form" from the super-offer-packages spec.

## Components Created

### 1. PackageSelector Component (`src/components/admin/PackageSelector.tsx`)
A modal component that allows admins to select and configure super offer packages when creating quotes.

**Features:**
- **Package Selection Interface (Subtask 11.1)**
  - Searchable list of active packages
  - Package preview on selection showing details and inclusions
  - Filter packages by destination
  - Real-time search across package name, destination, and resort

- **Selection Parameters Form (Subtask 11.2)**
  - Number of people input (1-100)
  - Number of nights dropdown (populated from package duration options)
  - Arrival date picker with minimum date validation
  - Input validation for all fields

- **Price Calculation Preview (Subtask 11.3)**
  - Automatic price calculation when parameters change
  - Calls `/api/admin/super-packages/calculate-price` endpoint
  - Displays calculated total price with breakdown
  - Shows tier and period used for calculation
  - Handles "ON REQUEST" pricing scenario with appropriate messaging
  - Loading states during calculation

- **Quote Form Integration (Subtask 11.4)**
  - Modal interface that opens from quote form
  - Passes selected package data back to parent
  - Closes automatically after selection

## QuoteForm Integration

### Updated QuoteForm Component (`src/components/admin/QuoteForm.tsx`)
Enhanced the existing QuoteForm to integrate with PackageSelector.

**New Features:**
- "Select Super Package" button in Package Details section
- Linked package information display showing:
  - Package name
  - Tier and period used
  - Visual indicator with checkmark icon
- Unlink package functionality
- Automatic form population when package is selected:
  - Number of people
  - Number of nights
  - Arrival date
  - Number of rooms (calculated)
  - What's included (from package inclusions)
  - Total price (if calculated)
  - Currency (from package)
  - Internal notes (accommodation examples)
- Manual adjustment capability after package application
- Super Package checkbox automatically checked

**Package Selection Flow:**
1. Admin clicks "Select Super Package" button
2. PackageSelector modal opens
3. Admin searches/filters and selects a package
4. Admin enters parameters (people, nights, date)
5. System calculates price automatically
6. Admin clicks "Apply Package"
7. Quote form fields are populated
8. Admin can make manual adjustments if needed
9. Admin saves the quote

## API Integration

The component integrates with existing API endpoints:
- `GET /api/admin/super-packages?status=active` - Fetch active packages
- `GET /api/admin/super-packages/[id]` - Fetch package details
- `POST /api/admin/super-packages/calculate-price` - Calculate price

## User Experience

### Visual Design
- Clean modal interface with two-column layout
- Left column: Package list with search and filters
- Right column: Package details, parameters, and price calculation
- Color-coded feedback:
  - Blue for linked package information
  - Green for successful price calculation
  - Amber for "ON REQUEST" pricing
  - Red for errors

### Interaction Flow
- Smooth transitions and loading states
- Real-time search and filtering
- Automatic price calculation on parameter change
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Disabled states for incomplete selections

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`src/components/admin/__tests__/PackageSelector.test.tsx`) covering:
- Component rendering (open/closed states)
- Package fetching and display
- Search functionality
- Destination filtering
- Package selection and preview
- Price calculation
- ON_REQUEST handling
- Apply and cancel actions
- Error handling

## Requirements Satisfied

All requirements from the spec have been met:

**Requirement 6.1**: ✅ Option to "Select Super Package" in quote form
**Requirement 6.2**: ✅ Searchable list of active packages with filtering
**Requirement 6.3**: ✅ Parameters form (people, nights, date) with validation
**Requirement 6.4**: ✅ Automatic quote population with package data
**Requirement 6.7**: ✅ ON_REQUEST scenario handling
**Requirement 6.8**: ✅ Manual adjustments allowed after application

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Local component state for modal visibility
- Form state managed by react-hook-form in QuoteForm
- Package data fetched and cached during modal session
- Price calculation triggered by useEffect on parameter changes

### Data Flow
1. PackageSelector fetches packages from API
2. User selects package and enters parameters
3. Price calculated via API call
4. Package data and calculation passed to parent via callback
5. Parent (QuoteForm) populates form fields
6. Form submission includes package reference

### Error Handling
- Network errors displayed to user
- Validation errors for invalid inputs
- Graceful handling of calculation failures
- Clear messaging for ON_REQUEST scenarios

## Files Modified/Created

**Created:**
- `src/components/admin/PackageSelector.tsx` - Main component
- `src/components/admin/__tests__/PackageSelector.test.tsx` - Test suite
- `PACKAGE_SELECTOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This document

**Modified:**
- `src/components/admin/QuoteForm.tsx` - Added PackageSelector integration

## Next Steps

The following tasks from the spec are ready to be implemented:
- Task 12: Enhance QuoteForm component with package integration (partially complete)
- Task 13: Enhance QuoteManager to display package information
- Task 14: Create admin navigation and routing
- Task 15: Implement error handling and user feedback

## Notes

- The component is fully functional and ready for use
- All TypeScript types are properly defined
- The implementation follows existing code patterns in the project
- The component is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- Manual adjustments are allowed after package application, giving admins flexibility
